## 🧠 Behind the Scenes: Matching Logic

* Normalization: Converts inputs to lowercase and strips spaces for consistent matching
* Synonyms: Education levels match common variants like "12th", "XII", "graduate", "bachelor"
* Flexible matching: Checks both dedicated fields (like caste, gender) and free-text eligibility info
* Fallbacks: If no clear title found for a scheme, skips it to avoid irrelevant matches
